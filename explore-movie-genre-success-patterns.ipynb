Success metrics that will be measured are: number of movies per genre, average ratings, total votes, and average budgets allocated to each genre.\n\n**Therefore, business task of this analysis is to explore the relationship between movie genres and success metrics to uncover patterns and insights.**\n\n**Stakeholders & Audience**\n\nFilm studios, marketing teams, and streaming platforms are interested in successful movie genres. Studios can use this data to guide their production decisions. Marketing teams tailor promotions for better campaigns, while streaming platforms improve user satisfaction by curating content based on genre preferences\n\n# Data\n\n*Prepare phase*\n\nThe dataset used for this analysis is [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) made available by Rounak Banik under a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). It has metadata about 45,000 movies, with data points including cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, ratings, release dates, languages, production companies, and more.\n\nThis dataset consists o the multiple csv files. For this purposes, I've used just the movies_metadata.csv which is the main Movies Metadata file. It contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.\n\nThis dataset is an ensemble of data collected from TMDB and GroupLens. The Movie Details, Credits and Keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.\n\n# Process\n\n*Process phase*\n\nThe data cleaning process, documented in detail within the analysis, was conducted using R. Errors were meticulously checked, and transformations were applied to ensure data readiness for analysis. Documentation of the cleaning process ensures transparency and reproducibility for review and sharing purposes.\n\n## Installing & Loading packages\n\nFor this project we've used following packages:\n\n-   Tidy verse\n-   GG Repel\n-   Plotly","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\noptions(scipen = 999)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\nlibrary(repr)\nlibrary('IRdisplay')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T22:23:15.628777Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T22:23:15.630635Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T22:23:15.656000Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing data\n\nAs previously described, for this project purposes we've used the movies_metadata.csv.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movie_dataset <- read.csv(\"/kaggle/input/the-movies-dataset/movies_metadata.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T22:23:19.423161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T22:23:19.424983Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T22:23:20.472757Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data cleaning\n\nChecking for missing values.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"missing_values <- sum(is.na(movie_dataset))\nmissing_values_by_column <- colSums(is.na(movie_dataset))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T22:23:25.534400Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T22:23:25.536232Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T22:23:25.559451Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Removing 0, NA rows and duplicates","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movie_dataset[movie_dataset==\"[]\"] <- NA\nmovie_dataset<- na.omit(movie_dataset)\nnames(movie_dataset)[6]<- \"m_id\"\nmovie_dataset<-distinct(movie_dataset)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T22:23:29.270774Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T22:23:29.273034Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T22:23:29.618685Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Removing not needed columns, and leaving just the ones needed for this analysis and previewing the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movies <- subset(movie_dataset, select = -c(adult, belongs_to_collection, homepage, overview, poster_path, tagline, spoken_languages, status, video, production_countries))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T22:23:32.616697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T22:23:32.618361Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T22:23:32.645098Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since some numeric data fields were stored as characters, we're changing it to numeric.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movies$budget <- as.numeric(movies$budget)\nmovies$revenue <- as.numeric(movies$revenue)\nmovies$release_date <- as.Date(movies$release_date)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-12T22:23:35.645665Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-12T22:23:35.647279Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-12T22:23:35.694848Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Executing various manipulations indicated by the comments.
